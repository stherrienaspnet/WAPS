.NET WebApi Angular Performance Seed where performance is the primary goal. 
For this seed application we do not intend to use Entity Framework because of the performance concern and prefer to use only Stored procedure. The data mapping is executed by Dapper as its perform so fast compare to other competitor.

Here is a list of component used:

SimpleInjector: Very fast IOC Container
Dapper: Very Fast ORM
Angular.Js: Very Fast UI Framework
SQL Server - Stored Procedure: Very Powerfull
